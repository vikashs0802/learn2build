# learn2build
This Reopsitory is made for solving some problems.
eg- 1. i am learning web development currently so i can build some great website modals and offcourse make a good carrer in field of web development.
    2. i faced a problem that is managing my learning so repository is made so i can learn some theories and apply in some projects here.
    3. these projects will be just for learning purpose as i will start with html so until then there will projects of using them in small projects and same will go on with new things.
    4. as there is no perticular way of managing this readme so it will be just according to small milestones.
